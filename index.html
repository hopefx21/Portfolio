    <h3>MY FOREX JOURNEY</h3>
<section id="forex-journey">
    <h1>THE JOURNEY OF SAD THROUGH FOREX</h1><p>
During my last semester of Senior High School (SHS), I began focusing on cryptocurrency and electronic coins, specifically on how people make money from them. During that time, I learned about Peer-to-Peer (P2P) trading, where people buy USDT using physical money through methods like Mobile Money (MoMo), cards, and bank transfers. After watching some documentaries, I discovered active trading. That’s when I found out you could trade those electronic currencies on financial markets. This is how I came to know the famous crypto trader in Africa, <strong>XM AHMED</strong>, a young Nigerian who dropped out of university in his third year (Level 300) to focus entirely on trading. I discovered him through the content he created with his partner, <strong>SEFEERA</strong>. He taught various aspects of trading, like psychology and risk management, which are essential for anyone thinking of becoming a trader.
</p><p>
Inspired by him, I started with crypto trading and joined his free Telegram group where he shared his analysis at no cost. If you wanted to learn his full approach, you had to pay for mentorship to understand how to navigate the financial market like a professional. People often asked, "If traders really make money from the market, why don't they teach for free?" But one thing I know is that vital information will cost you when you are truly committed to learning.
</p><p>
As I continued, I learned that the financial market isn't limited to cryptocurrency. You can also trade stocks, currencies, and many other instruments. I decided to focus on stocks and currencies because they were more accessible to me. Around this time, I discovered <strong>HABBY FX</strong> through a podcast interview where he mentioned learning forex from <strong>BABYPIPS</strong>. Without wasting time, I visited their website and began studying. I can say it helped tremendously; I learned many things about forex from there. They even list technical analysis strategies to learn. I'd say they complete about 60% of the job for you as a trader—the rest is up to you to figure out.
</p><p>
That remaining part includes understanding how the market behaves and how to approach it, which is where mentors come in. These are people who already understand the market's mechanics. You can choose to learn alone, but it will take you much longer, as all you see are candlesticks moving up and down without knowing what will happen next. If a mentor can teach you how the market works in three months, doing it on your own could take five to seven years, I promise you. That's why I chose to learn from mentors, which I will now discuss.
</p><hr><h2>FOREX BULLS ACADEMY EXPERIENCE</h2><p>
In <strong>January 2023</strong>, I joined the <strong>FOREX BULLS ACADEMY</strong>, run by <strong>DANIEL</strong>, a Kenyan trader, for a fee of $120. I raised 80% of this amount through profits from his free Telegram signals. The academy started from the very basics of forex so that even someone who had never heard of it could understand and become a trader. We learned many technical strategies, including <strong>Support and Resistance, Demand and Supply, Smart Money Concepts (SMC), and ICT</strong>. Among these, my favorite is using <strong>Demand and Supply combined with SMC</strong>.
</p><p>
It was a great academy with over 1,000 members and four tutors. We held classes every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. During my time in the group, I made friends from different countries like Nigeria, South Africa, and Kenya. I saw some as elder brothers and others as parental figures because I was the youngest in the group at that time.
</p><p>
Some friends and trading partners also created and shared signals, led by <strong>MR. FRED</strong>, a Nigerian trader who was doing very well. It was a great time with them before I began exploring other traders and encountered personal issues.
</p><p>
When my phone broke, I lost focus. Even after fixing it, although the group is still active, I no longer participate actively, but I plan to re-engage soon. I believe paying for that mentorship was an excellent decision, and Daniel’s team imparted great knowledge to me.
</p><hr><h2>COFFIEX FX MENTORSHIP</h2><p>
During that same January, I also paid for mentorship with a Ghanaian trader named <strong>COFFIEX FX</strong>. Our sessions started later that month. We were about six mentees in that batch, but I couldn't form friendships as we had no platform to communicate outside the sessions.
</p><p>
It was also a valuable experience, but I faced some challenges with the strategies taught and the lack of ongoing support for mentees. Unlike <strong>FOREX BULLS ACADEMY</strong>, which still keeps its 2023 mentees in a group for updates and continuous lessons on psychology and risk management, this structure was absent here.
</p><p>
During the webinars, it was promised that the two most proficient students would be recruited to their team—a promise that, in my view, wasn't fulfilled. Nevertheless, I still appreciate him and his team for deepening my knowledge of higher timeframes and their role in making sound long-term decisions. They are also skilled in technical and fundamental analysis. They are one of the best trading academies in Ghana, and I would recommend them to any serious beginner.
</p><hr><h2>MY PERSONAL EXPERIENCE IN THIS FOREX JOURNEY AND WHAT I LEARNED</h2><p>
My personal stance on forex is that it is <strong>not a get-rich-quick scheme</strong>, contrary to what many beginners believe. Personally, I wasn't drawn in by the flashy lifestyle of traders. I entered this field with a passion for generating legitimate digital income and a personal aversion to traditional 9–5 jobs.
</p><p>
On this journey, I faced many challenges, but I'll mention a few key ones. The most significant obstacle in this industry is <strong>psychology</strong>. What I can confidently say delays profitability is your mindset—how you perceive the financial market, your expectations from it, wanting it to behave as you wish, and, crucially, fear.
</p><p>
Fear is a complex factor that everyone must address before trading. You can excel in both fundamental and technical analysis and still be unprofitable due to your psychology. This is why people say that out of 100% of traders, only about 10% are profitable—not because they can't analyze charts, but because of how they approach the market.
</p><h3>Fear of Losing</h3>
<p>
Even though trading is not gambling (which I will discuss later), you will have losing days. If you are unwilling to lose money, then trading is not for you, as losses are part of the process. What ensures longevity in this industry is how you manage your losing days, especially during a losing streak. The solution is to be risk-oriented: plan every trade, decide how much you are willing to risk, and only risk what you are comfortable losing without emotional attachment.
</p><h3>Fear of Missing Out (FOMO)</h3>
<p>
Many traders enter trades without proper confirmation and confluence because they fear the move will happen without them. This leads to premature entries, where the market often hits their stop-loss as liquidity before moving in their intended direction. I experienced this as a beginner too. To combat FOMO, always have a defined edge and wait for the market to provide the specific confluence your strategy requires before entering. Stop rushing setups.
</p><p>
I will also add <strong>early exit</strong> to this list. Many traders close their trades just a few pips into profit or loss. Closing a trade at a small loss often stems from poor planning or not pre-defining the acceptable loss. Closing a trade too early in profit usually comes from a lack of trust in the setup and a fear of reversal. The best solution to both is proper risk management.
</p><p>
Many ask why I paid for different mentorships. The reason is that forex is not something you learn once and use forever. You must keep learning daily and refine your edge when necessary because we trade what we see, not what we know. Being in different communities helped me immensely in decision-making, as people constantly share their perspectives on potential market behavior.
</p><p>
Even with paid mentorships, I continued learning from <strong>KINGMAHNS, HABBY FX, and KOJO FX</strong> through their free tutorials, which were also incredibly helpful. Kingmahns' free teachings, in particular, helped me understand risk management, refine my edge, and improve my overall market approach.
</p><hr><h2>WHY TRADING IS NOT GAMBLING</h2><p>
While trading and gambling share superficial similarities—risk, the possibility of profit or loss, and the involvement of money—they are fundamentally different in intention, process, and structure when done correctly.
</p><p>
Sports betting and casino gambling are built on placing money on an uncertain outcome for the chance of winning more money. Equating them with disciplined trading ignores the profound differences in process, purpose, and control.
</p><p>
In a casino, you bet against the house on games of pure chance like roulette or slot machines, where the odds are mathematically fixed and always favor the house. In trading, you analyze a dynamic market where no single entity has a guaranteed, pre-set edge against you. The casino’s profit is structurally assured over time, but the market’s direction is not.
</p><p>
In sports betting, once you place your wager, you have no control. You cannot adjust your position if circumstances change. In trading, you actively manage risk. You can set a stop-loss, take partial profits, or exit based on new information.
</p><p>
Casino games offer fixed odds and predetermined payouts that create a known negative expected value for the player. In trading, your potential reward is not fixed—it is managed through risk-reward ratios, where the target profit is intentionally set as a multiple of the potential loss. A trader builds positive expectancy through strategy rather than accepting a platform’s negative one.
</p><p>
While gambling is primarily about entertainment, trading’s primary goal is capital growth and preservation. Emotion is part of the product in gambling, but in trading, emotion is the enemy—discipline and process are the tools.
</p><p>
A single bet ends with the match or game, but a single trade is part of a larger portfolio managed over time. A gambler’s success is measured by isolated wins, while a trader’s success is measured by consistency across hundreds of trades.
</p><p>
In short: <strong>A gambler hopes to get lucky. A trader aims to be consistently proficient.</strong> The former is a pastime; the latter, when done professionally, is a skilled financial profession.

    • <strong>Lower Timeframes (5-15 min):</strong> Precise entry execution
    </p>
    <h3>STEP 3: ENTRY STRATEGY</h3>
    <p>
    Wait for price to sweep liquidity before tapping into key zones:<br>
    • Supply and Demand Zones<br>
    • Order Blocks and Breakers<br>
    • Support and Resistance Levels<br>
    • Areas where institutional traders (Smart Money) are likely to act
    </p>
    
    <h3>STEP 4: RISK MANAGEMENT</h3>
    <p>
    Strict rules to preserve capital:<br>
    • <strong>1% Rule:</strong> Risk only 1% of capital per trade<br>
    • <strong>Target:</strong> Aim for 1:5 reward-to-risk ratio<br>
    • <strong>Caution Zone:</strong> Take partial profits at 1:3<br>
    • Never move stop loss to break-even too early
    </p>
    
    <h3>KEY FOCUS AREAS</h3>
    <p>
    • Smart Money Concepts (SMC) - following institutional footprints<br>
    • Order Blocks - areas where big players have placed orders<br>
    • Liquidity Sweeps - waiting for stops to be taken<br>
    • Change of Character (ChoCh) - confirming trend changes<br>
    • Volatility Analysis - ensuring proper market conditions
    </p>
    
    <h3>PSYCHOLOGY & DISCIPLINE</h3>
    <p>
    • <strong>No Revenge Trading:</strong> After a loss, step away<br>
    • <strong>Trading Journal:</strong> Record every trade with screenshots<br>
    • <strong>Regular Backtesting:</strong> Review past trades weekly<br>
    • <strong>Patience:</strong> Wait for proper confirmation before entry<br>
    • <strong>No Early Exits:</strong> Don't close losing trades without confirmation<br>
    • <strong>News First:</strong> Always check fundamentals before analyzing charts
    </p>
    
    <h3>PREFERENCES</h3>
    <p>
    I focus on these instruments:<br>
    • <strong>Forex:</strong> USDJPY, GBPJPY, EURUSD<br>
    • <strong>Commodities:</strong> Gold (XAUUSD)<br>
    • <strong>Crypto:</strong> Bitcoin (BTCUSD)
    </p>
    
    <h3>MY TRADING PHILOSOPHY</h3>
    <p>
    "Fundamentals first, then technicals. Trade what you see, not what you hope.<br>
    Let price action tell the story with news context, manage risk before reward,<br>
    and be patient enough to wait for high-probability setups only."
